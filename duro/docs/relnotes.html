<h1>Release Notes for Duro 0.8</h1>

<h2>Nested transactions</h2>

<p>The execution of a parent transaction is suspended while a child
transaction executes. It is an error to perform an operation under
the control of a transaction which has a running child transaction.

<h2>Creating libraries</h2>

<p>Libraries for user-defined types and operators must be created
using GNU Libtool. The name of the library is passed without
the file extension.

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>Duro 0.8 supports indexes and has limited query optimization
capabilities. Only "equality queries" will use an index.
For example, if a compound index for attributes A and B has been created,
T WHERE A=1 AND B=2 will use the index, but T WHERE A=1 will not,
neither will T WHERE A=1 AND B>2.

<h2>Expressions</h2>

<p>Duro 0.8 expressions may not contain relation-valued expressions
which contain variables referring to variables in the enclosing expression.
In other words, a relation-valued RDB_expression may only represent a table,
but not a general relation-valued expression.

<p>For key attributes, an index is created automatically.
