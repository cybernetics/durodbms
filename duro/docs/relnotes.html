<h1>Release Notes for Duro 0.9</h1>

<h2>Nested transactions</h2>

<p>The execution of a parent transaction is suspended while a child
transaction executes. It is an error to perform an operation under
the control of a transaction which has a running child transaction.

<h2>Creating libraries</h2>

<p>Libraries for user-defined types and operators must be created
using GNU Libtool. The name of the library is passed without
the file extension.

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>Duro 0.9 supports hash and B-tree indexes, and
does some amount of query optimization.

<p>For each candidate key, a hash index is created automatically.

<h2>Expressions</h2>

<p>Duro 0.9 expressions may not contain relation-valued expressions
which contain variables referring to variables in the enclosing expression.
In other words, a relation-valued RDB_expression may only represent a table,
but not a general relation-valued expression.
