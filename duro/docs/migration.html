<h2>Migrating data from older versions</h2>

<p>Currently Duro contains no tool that migrates data to a newer version.
So the only safe way to migrate data to a newer version is to perform the
following steps:

<ol>
<li>Create a new database environment
<li>Create the database(s)
<li>Create the user-defined types and operators
<li>Create the real tables and import the data from the old database environment
<li>Create the virtual tables
<li>Create the database constraints
</ol>

<p>Durodump can be used to extract the real tables and their data
from the old DB environment and to import it into the new environment.
You may want to take durodump.tcl from the new version and use it
under the old version to export the real tables because there are some issues
with durodump.tcl in older versions.
