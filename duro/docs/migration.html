<h2>Migrating data from older versions</h2>

<p>Currently DuroDBMS contains no tool that migrates data to a newer version.
So the only safe way to migrate data from an old version to DuroDBMS 0.16
is to create a new database environment and re-create the database(s), 
user-defined types and operators, tables and database constraints.

<p>Durodump can be used to extract the real tables and their data
from the old DB environment and to import them into the new environment.
You may want to take durodump.tcl from the new version and use it
under the old version to export the real tables because there are some issues
with durodump.tcl in older versions.
(For example, the restore script created by the old Durodump always
tries to re-create the database which causes a problem if a user-defined
type must be re-created first)
