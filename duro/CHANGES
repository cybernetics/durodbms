Summary of Changes for Duro

Changes for Duro 0.4

- Persistent virtual tables now supported through RDB_set_table_name()
  and RDB_make_persistent()

- Releasing databases no longer required before closing the environment

- Added operators < > <= >=

- RDB_init_value(), RDB_init_array(), and RDB_init_tuple() do no longer
  return an error code (the error checking, if necessary, is delayed
  to first use of the variable). This makes initialization/deinitialization
  code much simpler.

- Fixed alignment bug

- Added data type BINARY

Changes for Duro 0.3

- Changed command line arguments of utility programs, added utility function
  RDB_getargs() to read command line arguments

- Changed array interface

- Added RDB_init_value()

- Renamed RDB_open_db to RDB_get_db and RDB_close_db to RDB_release_db

- RDB_drop_db now takes pointer to RDB_database as argument

- Minor internal API changes

- Bugfix (Projection over virtual table crashed)

- Fixed bug in intersection, added test

- Added argument "persistent" to RDB_create_table()

- Aggregate operation

Changes for Duro 0.2

- Switched to Berkeley DB 4.1

- Added support for projection (through RDB_project())

- RDB_create_table() now allows for more than one candidate key

- Renamed the Relational Algebra functions: RDB_table_select()
  becomes RDB_select(), etc. These functions are now the
  recommended way to create queries.
