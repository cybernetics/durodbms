Summary of Changes for Duro

Changes for Duro 0.6

- For the sake of uniformity, changed argument order of RDB_table_to_array()

- RDB_array_get_tuple() now obtains a pointer to a RDB_tuple.

- Added sorting (through the seqitc/seqitv arguments of
  RDB_table_to_array())

- Renamed RDB_value as RDB_object. Renamed RDB_init_value() as
  RDB_init_obj(), etc.

- RDB_drop_type now takes a RDB_transaction * argument

- More API changes. A draft API spec is now available.

- Replaced structure RDB_key_attrs by the more general RDB_string_vec.

- Implemented user-defined operators.

- Added support for default table attributes.

- Fixed issue with RDB_update().

- Added error logging.

- RDB_get_table now takes a RDB_transaction * argument.

- Implemented user-defined types.

- Renamed field "type" in RDB_attr as "typ", for the sake of uniformity.

Changes for Duro 0.5

- Added RDB_extract_tuple() to extract a single tuple from a table.

- Bugfixes

- Added regular expression matching (requires POSIX.2 regular expressions)

- Added argument 'options' to RDB_create_env().

- Added support for RENAME and SUMMARIZE PER (except COUNTD, SUMD, and AVGD).

- Changed error handling: Implicit rollback also by other system errors
  than deadlock; added function RDB_is_syserr() for checking for system
  errors.

- Renamed RDB_deinit_XXX functions as RDB_destroy_XXX.

- Now checking table and attribute names: nonprintable characters, whitespace,
and '$' are not permitted.

- Renamed field 'value' in RDB_virtual_attr as 'exp'.

- Made RDB_rel_table() the only way to create a relational expression.

Changes for Duro 0.4

- Persistent virtual tables now supported through RDB_set_table_name()
  and RDB_make_persistent()

- Releasing databases no longer required before closing the environment

- Added operators < > <= >=

- RDB_init_value(), RDB_init_array(), and RDB_init_tuple() do no longer
  return an error code (the error checking, if necessary, is delayed
  to first use of the variable). This makes initialization/deinitialization
  code much simpler.

- Fixed alignment bug

- Added data type BINARY
