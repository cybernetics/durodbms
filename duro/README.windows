	README for Duro 0.11

$Id$

This directory contains the binary Windows release 0.12 of Duro, a relational
database library.

Complete source code is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/duro.

The following software is required for running Duro:

- Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store, release 4.3 or later
- POSIX.2 regular expressions (e.g., GNU Regex)
- GNU Libtool
- Tcl 8.1 or later

Add the directories where the respective DLLs are located to PATH,
together with the 'bin' subdirectory of the Duro root directory.

Duro 0.12 has been tested under Linux/x86 and Windows XP with Berkeley
DB 4.4 and Tcl 8.4.

To learn about how to use Duro, see the documentation in the 'docs'
subdirectory. Example code can be found in the 'tests' subdirectory
of the source release.

The Tcl interface can be found in the 'lib' subdirectory.
The simplest way to make it available to application
scripts is to add this subdirectory to TCLLIBPATH, e.g.:

    TCLLIBPATH=/usr/local/duro.0.11/lib
    export TCLLIBPATH

To run Duroadmin, run duroadmin.tcl from the 'bin' subdirectory
after setting TCLLIBPATH as described above. Duroadmin requires
the TkTable extension, which is part of ActiveTcl, available
from tcl.activestate.com.

Duro is still under development. Report bugs to
rhartmann@users.sourceforge.net.
