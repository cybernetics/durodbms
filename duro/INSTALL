Installation procedure for DuroDBMS
===================================

DuroDBMS uses SCons to build itself. Type:

scons
scons jni	(optional, builds the JNI interface)
scons test  (optional, runs the tests)
scons install

SCons is available from www.scons.org.

To compile DuroDBMS, you need GNU Libtool, Berkeley DB (5.3 recommended) and Tcl (8.1 or later).

Building the JNI interface requires Java Development Kit 7. 

'scons test' requires the tcltest package.

Berkeley DB is assumed to be located in /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.5.3.
If Berkeley DB is located in a different directory, you can
pass this directory to SCons using the bdbhome variable, so
if Berkeley DB is located in /usr instead of /usr/local,
you may use:

scons bdbhome=/usr/BerkeleyDB5.3

The location of Berkeley DB may also be specified using
the environment. With Visual C++, the variables LIB and INCLUDE
can be used.

By default, DuroDBMS is installed in C:\duro.0.22 on Windows, and
/usr/local/duro.0.22 on all other systems.
You can specify a different directory by passing an installdir
variable to scons, e. g.:

scons installdir=/usr install

This will install DuroDBMS in /usr/duro.0.22.

To build DuroDBMS without Tcl support, use:

scons with_durotcl=0

Note that since most tests depend on Durotcl, running the tests will not
be possible in this case. Duroadmin will not be available either.
