Installation procedure for Duro on Linux/Unix
=============================================

Duro uses automake and autoconf to build itself. Type:

./configure
make
make check    (optional)
make install

To compile Duro, you need GNU Libtool, Berkeley DB 4.3,
and Tcl 8.1 or later.

Depending on the system, it may be necessary to use link Duro applications
with libpthread. This can be specified by when running configure:

./configure LIBS=-lpthread

Berkeley DB is assumed to be located in /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.3.
If Berkeley DB is located in a different directory, set the BDB_HOME
environment variable and use the -e option of make.

To build Duro without Tcl support, pass --without-tcl to configure.
Note that since most tests depend on Durotcl, 'make check' will not
work in this case. Duroadmin will not be available too.
