$Id$

This directory contains the source code of DuroDBMS, a relational database
management system.

The following software is required for compiling and running DuroDBMS:

- Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store (release 5.3 recommended)
- POSIX.2 regular expressions
- GNU Libtool
- Tcl 8.5 or later
- SCons 1.2.0 or later
- GNU Readline

DuroDBMS has been tested under Linux/x86 and Windows XP with Berkeley
DB 5.3 and Tcl 8.5.

To learn about how to use DuroDBMS, see the documentation in the 'docs'
subdirectory. Example code can be found in the 'tests' subdirectory
of the build directory.

When DuroDBMS is installed, the Tcl interface is installed as a package in
the 'lib' subdirectory. The simplest way to make it available to application
scripts is to add this subdirectory to TCLLIBPATH, e.g.:

    TCLLIBPATH=/usr/local/durodbms.0.19/lib
    export TCLLIBPATH

DuroDBMS is still under development. Report bugs to
rhartmann@users.sourceforge.net.
