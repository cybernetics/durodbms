	README for Duro 0.1
$Id$

This directory contains release 0.3 of Duro, a relational
database library written in C.

To compile Duro, simply run make in this directory.
'make test' will build and run the test suite.

Compiling and running Duro requires the Berkeley DB database library,
release 4.1.

Berkeley DB is assumed to be located in /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.1.
If Berkeley DB is located in a different directory, modify make.vars
appropriately.

Duro has been tested on a GNU/Linux PC. Building Duro on a different
system may require some modifications to the Makefiles.

Berkeley DB can be obtained for free from http://www.sleepycat.com.

To learn about how to use the Duro, see rel/rdb.h and the programs
located in the directories util and tests.

This software is still under development. Report bugs to rehartmann@t-online.de.

Programming notes:

- If a table from which an array was created is dropped before the transaction
  which was used to create the array was terminated, this transaction
  must be used when dropping the table.

Known bugs:

- RDB_update() does not work always correctly if a key is updated.
  See the comments in the code for details.

- An RDB_array becomes invalid after the end of the transaction in which
  it was created.
