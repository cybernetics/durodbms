	README for DuroDBMS

The parent directory of this directory contains the source code of DuroDBMS,
a relational database management system.

The following software is required for compiling and running DuroDBMS:

- Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store (release 6.1 or later)
- POSIX.2 regular expressions
- GNU Libtool
- Tcl 8.5 or later
- SCons 1.2.0 or later
- GNU Readline (not under MS Windows)

DuroDBMS has been tested under Linux/x86 and Windows XP with Berkeley DB 6.1
and Tcl 8.5.

To learn about how to use DuroDBMS, see the documentation in the 'docs'
subdirectory. Example code can be found in the 'tests' subdirectory
of the build directory.

When DuroDBMS is installed, the Tcl interface is installed as a package in
the 'lib' subdirectory. The simplest way to make it available to application
scripts is to add this subdirectory to TCLLIBPATH, e.g.:

    TCLLIBPATH=/usr/local/durodbms.1.1/lib
    export TCLLIBPATH

Tips

If a DuroDBMS process crashes when a transaction is active, it may leave
the database environment in an inconsistent state, making it impossible to
access the environment again. In this case, run the Berkeley DB utility
db_recover to bring the environment back to a consistent state
or use connect(<envdir>, true).

DuroDBMS is still under development. Report bugs to
rhartmann@users.sourceforge.net.
