	README for Duro 0.13

$Id$

This directory contains release 0.13 of Duro, a relational database library.

The following software is required for compiling and running Duro:

- Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store, release 4.3 or later
- POSIX.2 regular expressions
- GNU Libtool
- Tcl 8.1 or later

Duro 0.13 has been tested under Linux/x86 and Windows XP with Berkeley
DB 4.5 and Tcl 8.4.

To learn about how to use Duro, see the documentation in the 'docs'
subdirectory. Example code can be found in the 'tests' subdirectory
of the build directory.

When Duro is installed, the Tcl interface is installed as a package in
the 'lib' subdirectory. The simplest way to make it available to application
scripts is to add this subdirectory to TCLLIBPATH, e.g.:

    TCLLIBPATH=/usr/local/duro.0.12/lib
    export TCLLIBPATH

To run Duroadmin, run duroadmin.tcl from the 'bin' subdirectory
after setting TCLLIBPATH as described above. Duroadmin requires
the TkTable extension, which is part of ActiveTcl, available
from tcl.activestate.com.

Duro is still under development. Report bugs to
rhartmann@users.sourceforge.net.
