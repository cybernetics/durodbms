	README for Duro 0.6

$Id$

This directory contains release 0.7 of Duro, a relational database library.

The following software is required for compiling and running Duro:

- Berkeley DB, release 4.1 or later
- POSIX.2 regular expressions
- GNU Libtool
- Tcl 8.1 or later

Duro 0.7 has been tested on a GNU/Linux PC with BerkeleyDB 4.2 and Tcl 8.4.

To learn about how to use Duro, see the documentation in the 'docs'
subdirectory. Example code can be found in the 'tests' subdirectory
of the build directory.

By default, Duro is installed in the directory /usr/local/duro.0.7.

When Duro is installed, the Tcl interface is installed as a package in
the 'lib' subdirectory. To use it from aplication scripts, the
following code can be used:

    lappend auto_path "/usr/local/duro.0.7/lib"
    package require duro

The Berkeley DB library directory must be added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Duro is still under development. Report bugs to
rhartmann@users.sourceforge.net.
