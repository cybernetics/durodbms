	README for Duro 0.5
$Id$

This directory contains release 0.6 of Duro, a relational database library
written in C.

Compiling and running Duro requires the Berkeley DB database library,
release 4.1. Berkeley DB can be obtained for free from
http://www.sleepycat.com. Also required are POSIX.2 regular expressions
and GNU Libtool.

Berkeley DB is assumed to be located in /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.1.

Duro has been tested on a GNU/Linux PC.

To learn about how to use the Duro, see the API specification
and Release Notes in the 'docs' directory.

This software is still under development. Report bugs to
rhartmann@users.sourceforge.net.

Known bugs:

- RDB_update() does not work always correctly if a key is updated.
  See the comments in the code for details.

- An RDB_array becomes invalid after the end of the transaction in which
  it was created.

- A table from which a RDB_array was created must not be dropped before
  the array is destroyed.
