	README for Duro 0.8

$Id$

This directory contains release 0.8 of Duro, a relational database library.

The following software is required for compiling and running Duro:

- Berkeley DB, release 4.1 or later
- POSIX.2 regular expressions
- GNU Libtool
- Tcl 8.1 or later

Duro 0.8 has been tested under Linux/x86 with Berkeley DB 4.2 and Tcl 8.4.

To learn about how to use Duro, see the documentation in the 'docs'
subdirectory. Example code can be found in the 'tests' subdirectory
of the build directory.

By default, Duro is installed in the directory /usr/local/duro.0.8.

When Duro is installed, the Tcl interface is installed as a package in
the 'lib' subdirectory. To make it available to application scripts, the
simplest way is to add ths subdirectory to TCLLIBPATH, e.g.:

    TCLLIBPATH=/usr/local/duro.0.8/lib
    export TCLLIBPATH

The Berkeley DB library directory must be added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

To run Duroadmin, run duroadmin.tcl from the 'bin' subdirectory
after setting TCLLIBPATH as described above. Duroadmin requires
the TkTable extension, which is part of ActiveTcl, available
from tcl.activestate.com.

Duro is still under development. Report bugs to
rhartmann@users.sourceforge.net.
