	README for Duro 0.6

$Id$

This directory contains release 0.6 of Duro, a relational database library
written in C.

Compiling and running Duro requires the Berkeley DB database library,
release 4.1. Berkeley DB can be obtained for free from
http://www.sleepycat.com. Also required are POSIX.2 regular expressions
and GNU Libtool.

Berkeley DB is assumed to be located in /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.1.

Duro has been tested on a GNU/Linux PC.

To learn about how to use Duro, see the API specification
and release notes in the 'docs' directory. Example code
can be found in the 'tests' directory.

By default, Duro is installed in the directory /usr/local/duro.0.6.

Duro is still under development. Report bugs to
rhartmann@users.sourceforge.net.
