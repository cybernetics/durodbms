	README for Duro 0.5
$Id$

This directory contains release 0.5 of Duro, a relational database library
written in C.

Compiling and running Duro requires the Berkeley DB database library,
release 4.1. Berkeley DB can be obtained for free from
http://www.sleepycat.com. Also required are POSIX.2 regular expressions
and Libtool.

Berkeley DB is assumed to be located in /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.1.
If Berkeley DB is located in a different directory, modify make.vars
appropriately. 

Duro has been tested on a GNU/Linux PC.

To learn about how to use the Duro, see rel/rdb.h and the programs
located in the directories util and tests.

This software is still under development. Report bugs to
rhartmann@users.sourceforge.net.

Known bugs:

- RDB_update() does not work always correctly if a key is updated.
  See the comments in the code for details.

- An RDB_array becomes invalid after the end of the transaction in which
  it was created.

- A table from which a RDB_array was created must not be dropped before
  the array is destroyed.
