	README for Dreisam 0.1

This directory contains the source code of Dreisam,
an MVC web application framework.

To compile and run Dreisam, you need DuroDBMS and the FastCGI library.

Get the current version of DuroDBMS from http://sourceforge.net/p/duro-hg/code/ci/default/tree. 
(The Tarball version does not work as it lacks the HTML escaping operator needed by Dreisam)

The FastCGI library can be obtained from http://fastcgi.com. 

Dreisam is still in early stages of development. Report bugs to
rhartmann@users.sourceforge.net.
