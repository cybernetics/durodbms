Installing Dreisam
==================

Dreisam uses SCons to build itself. Typing

scons

will build the front controller dreisam.fcgi.

scons deploy

will build the front controller and copy it to /var/www/fcgi-bin.

To compile Dreisam, DuroDBMS and the FastCGI library is required.
See the file README for more details.
